# Project Proposal
Food Hygiene app is an app that will be designed to improve food hygiene awareness, monitoring food vendors and restaurants. The app will be both an informative and monitoring app. Can have features like such as hygiene checklists, inspection scheduling and customer feedback.
## Business Case
Food related diseases affect millions globally each year, resulting in significant public health and economic impacts.
### Problem statement
Many food vendors/restaurants lack access to proper training and hygiene monitoring tools. Inspection systems used by health authorities are often manual, inefficient and paper-based. 

### Business benefits
 To help people know about hygiene ratings and encourage other restaurants to try and improve their ratings. Simplifies documentation of inspections

### Options Considered
 Consumers can directly check offical databases such as the UK Food Standards Agency (FSA) hygiene rating site. This is quite reliable and up-to-date however, it is not convenient and isn't user friendly as an app. Restaurant reviews are often include hygiene comments or ratings from personal experiences from customers. The only potential con I can see at the moment is that from this perspective is that it is not offical ratings so can be misleading.

### Expected Risks
Low user adoption
Data/security concerns
inaccurate or manipulated data
system downtime
legal challeges
limited financial sustainablity
negative public feedback
cultural barriers
